      <h1>Byte Heist</h1>
      <p>
        Byte Heist is a site where you can test your coding skills by solving challenges in as few bytes as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site will be similar to sites like code.golf, anarchy golf, and the late week.golf. Some unique features will include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Challenges will have a finite run time, probably around 6 months. After this time all solutions will be made public.
        </li>
        <li>
          A highly customizable judging system that will allow things like restricted source challenges, alternate scoring systems, self referential challenges etc. Though I also
          hope to have a good selection of basic code golf challenges too.
        </li>
        <li>
          Easily upload and colaberate on challenges via the interface. Built in ways to vote on challenges, give feedback, suggest test cases etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be curated challenges that contribute to a global leaderboard, but you can also create private challenges to play with your friends,
          or to use for C.M.C.s etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Right now there are already a few challenges you can try. Many things are incomplete. Expect the database to be wiped before 1.0.
      </p>

# Welcome to Byte Heist

Byte Heist is a site with coding challenges. It's similar to sites like
HackerRank, LeetCode, or Advent of Code, except the scoring system is based on
the *length* of your code.

| Normal Code Challenges | Code Golf |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| Can be fun | Can be fun |
| Train algorithms and data structures | Train programming language internals and edge cases |
| Train architecture and readable code | Train mathematics |
| Very satisfying when you finally solve a challenge | Very satisfying when you finally solve a challenge |

**You don't need to care about your score.** Optimising your score is optional. Feel free
to submit fully commented solutions if you prefer to code that way.

## How to have the most fun

It can be tempting to try to get to the top of the leaderboard, fail and give up. Trying to compare yourself against the top users is a recipe for frustration.

Instead, try to gradually improve your solutions over time. 

I have these tips for having the most fun on the site:

- Start by just solving the challenge. Use full length variable names, indentation, and
anything you can do to make it more readable. No point in optimizing if you don't have an efficient solution at all.
- Think about the problem overnight, or in the next few days and weeks. Code golf mostly works by getting a random idea during your morning commute, not by staring at the problem.
- Don't be afraid to try "stupid" ideas. Sometimes an algorithm that feels less elegant gets you a better score. Sometimes you change a whole bit of your code for no score change but which allows saving bytes somewhere else.

## OK, but how do I actually get decent scores?

I will just re-iterate that it's more about personal enjoyment and learning than scores. However, I will link to some resources which might help you:

### General Resources

- [Code.golf wiki](https://code.golf/wiki)
- [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)
- [Tips for golfing in <all languages> on Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/5285/tips-for-golfing-in-all-languages)
- [The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/)

### Python Specific

- [Tips for Golfing in Python on Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/54/tips-for-golfing-in-python) - A lot of tips but many are low quality
- [Tips for golfing in Python on code.golf wiki](https://code.golf/wiki/langs/python) - Handful of applicable tips, some are code.golf specific
- [Code Golfing in Python on Geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/code-golfing-in-python/) - Beginner friendly resource
- [Tips for Golfing in Python on codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/) - Beginner friendly resource

### JavaScript (Deno/Node) Specific

- [Tips for Golfing in JavaScript on Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/2682/tips-for-golfing-in-javascript) - A lot of tips but many are low quality 
- [JavaScript on the code.golf wiki](https://code.golf/wiki/langs/javascript) - A handful of decent quality tips, some are code.golf specific

Deno will probably be removed from the site at some point.

### C Specific

C being ancient means there are many tips online, but they're very scattered. It pays to do some research.

- [Tips for golfing in C on Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/2203/tips-for-golfing-in-c) - Many answers, mostly low quality
- [C on the code.golf wiki](https://code.golf/wiki/langs/c) - Byte Heist uses the same [TCC](https://bellard.org/tcc/) compiler as code.golf, so tips regarding its idiosyncrasies should apply here too.

### Rust Specific

Golfing in Rust is less popular, so there are fewer resources available. However, this means you have the opportunity to invent new tricks yourself.

- [Tips for golfing in Rust on Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/74096/tips-for-golfing-in-rust) - For Rust, the tips on Code Golf Stack Exchange seem to actually be decent quality
- [Rust on the Code.golf wiki](https://code.golf/wiki/langs/rust) - The top section is code.golf specific but the "Random Tips" are helpful on Byte Heist
- [Iterator Trait on Rust Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) - Most Rust golfing comes down to choosing the correct method on the Iterator trait, so knowing all of them is quite helpful.

### Kotlin Specific

I do not actually know much about golfing in Kotlin, so if someone is willing to help [fill out](https://github.com/mousetail/Byte-Heist/edit/master/doc/Intro_to_Code_Golf.md) this section, that would be helpful.

### TinyAPL specific

TinyAPL is specifically designed for code golf so the official documentation is quite helpful.

- [TinyAPL Documentation](https://tinyapl.rubenverg.com/)
- [TinyAPL on GitHub](https://github.com/rubenVerg/tinyAPL)
- [TinyAPL on RubenVerg (Madeline)'s Blog](https://blog.rubenverg.com/?tag=tinyapl)


### Vyxal specific

Vyxal is specifically designed for code golf so the official documentation is quite helpful.

- [Official Vyxal 3 Tour](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/blob/version-3/documentation/Tour.md)
- [Tips for Golfing in Vyxal 3 on Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/267048/tips-for-golfing-in-vyxal-3)
- [Official Vyxal 3 Tips and Tricks page](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/blob/version-3/documentation/tipsandtricks.md)
- [Wiki Page on code.golf](https://code.golf/wiki/langs/vyxal) - A few basic tips only

Note Vyxal 2 will probably be removed from the site eventually.
